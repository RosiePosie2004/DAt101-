      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				I would use constants for values that never change, like pi or a fixed number, and variables for values that can change, like a game score. Not everything can be constant because some things need to change.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses change the order of operations in math. The numbers inside the parentheses is calculated first, which can change the result.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can limit floating-point numbers to a certain number of decimals by rounding them, like using methods that let us show only two decimals.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				Because floating-point numbers can be slightly off, we cant always check if they are exactly equal. We check if they are close enough instead, for example by seeing if the difference is very small. 
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators give back either true or false. We can check if they are true or false by printing them or using them in an if statement.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() gives a random number between 0 and 1. It can be used for games, picking something randomly, or simulating chance.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus (%) gives the remainder when you divide one number by another. We use it to check things like whether a number is even or odd, or to divide things into groups.
